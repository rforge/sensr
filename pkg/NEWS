This file documents updates and changes in package sensR since version
1.0.0

Oct. 9. 2009:

- betabin has been completely rewritten with option to choose the
  chance corrected beta-binomial model as well as the ordinary
  beta-binomial model.
- discrim, discrimPwr, discrimSS and findcr have been updated to allow
  for difference as well as similarity tests and have grown an
  argument 'pd0 = 0' to indicate the proportion of discriminators in
  the population. All help pages have been updated.
- references updated in help files to published same-diff paper and
  in-press GLIM paper

June 17. 2010: version 1.2.0:

- the twoAC() function and its print method is introduced for
  estimation of d-prime and tau in the 2-AC protocol
- the clls function and its methods are no longer supported. 
  The user is adviced to use clm() from package ordinal instead. 

July 20. 2010: version 1.2.1:

- the following methods for twoAC objects are now available: confint,
  profile, confint.profile and plot.profile.

October 13. 2010: version 1.2.2:

- rescale function and additional auxiliary (psyfun, psyinv, psyderiv,
  pc2pd, pd2pc) functions included
- major revision of betabin: argument Pguess has been removed and the
  method argument is now the sensory discrimination protocol rather
  than the parameterization of the beta-binomial model. The summary
  method has gained the argument level instead of alpha. The results
  of the summary method are much more extensive with results in terms
  of Pc, Pd and d-prime.
- revision of findcr function. It is now faster and more reliable
  since it is using uniroot rather than a simple while loop and an
  explicit test that the return value is in fact the critical value is
  conducted.  
- Error in discrimSim for the threeAFC method corrected.

October 28. 2010: version 1.2.3:

- major revision of discrim, discrimPwr and discrimSS including
  confint.discrim, profile.discrim, print.discrim and
  plot.profile.discrim. 

November 25. 2010: version 1.2.4:

- Vignette 'Methodology' describes the statistical methodology of
  sensory discrimination tests. 
- Added the convenience functions d.primePwr and d.primeSS.

November 26. 2010: version 1.2.5:

- print.anota is fixed.
- confint.anota and plot.anota functions added and documented in the
  AnotA help file. Examples added to help page.

December 9. 2010: version 1.2.6:

- corrections made to Statistical Methodology vignette.

March 3. 2011: version 1.2.7:

- major update of twoAC implementation
- added exact power computations for the 2-AC protocol in function
  twoACpwr

March 8. 2011: version 1.2.8:

- added clm2twoAC function for extracting 2-AC parameters etc. from
  cumulative link models (clm[m]s from package ordinal)
- including "Examples for 2-AC paper" as vignette

April 8. 2011: version 1.2.9:

- correcting t and f as logicals in sweave vignettes to TRUE and FALSE
  (mail from Brian Ripley 11-04-08) 

May 10. 2011: version 1.2.10:

- completing partially matched arguments.

August 12. 2011: version 1.2.11:

- updating clm2twoAC() to accomodate change to ordinal::clm

August 19. 2011: version 1.2.12:

- interchanging the second and third arguments of AUC.default

September 23. 2011: version 1.2.13:

- bug in plot.discrim (mean separation of perceptual curves was wrong)
  corrected. 

November 14. 2011: version 1.2.14:

- completing partially matched argument lower -> lower.tail in pnorm.
