Description: Provides methods for sensory discrimination methods;
  duotrio, tetrad, triangle, 2-AFC, 3-AFC, A-not A, same-different and
  2-AC. This enables the calculation of d-primes, standard errors of
  d-primes, sample size and power computations, and
  comparisons of different d-primes. Methods for profile likelihood
  confidence intervals and plotting are included.
